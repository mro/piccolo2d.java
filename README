This is the Piccolo README file

INTRODUCTION
	
Welcome to Piccolo! Piccolo is a revolutionary way (in the Jazz ZUI 
tradition) to create robust, full-featured graphical applications in 
Java, with striking features such as zooming and multiple representation. 
Piccolo is an extensive toolkit based on the Java2D API.

REQUIRMENTS

To run Piccolo applications you need to install the Java 2 Runtime Environment (1.4), 
which can be downloaded from "http://www.javasoft.com/j2se/".

To build Piccolo itself you need Apache Maven2, which can be downloaded from
http://maven.apache.org/.

GETTING STARTED

1) check out: svn checkout  svn checkout http://piccolo2d.googlecode.com/svn/piccolo.java/trunk piccolo.java
2) change into the directory: cd piccolo.java
3) build jars and doc: mvn clean install site

This builds three jar files in the local maven cache. 
($HOME/.m2/repository/edu/umd/cs/hcil/*/1.3-SNAPSHOT/*.jar) and quite a bit
of documentation in ./target/site/index.html and ./*/target/site/index.html
